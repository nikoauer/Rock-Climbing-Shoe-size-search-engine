              Unlike sneakers or hiking boots, choosing a climbing shoe for the
              first time is more than looking at the "top 5 brands" or "best
              shoe for climbing". The best climbing shoe for your first pair is
              one that fits tight and comfortable, while providing the right
              balance of support and durability for your current climbing
              experience. A friend recommended shoe is a good place to start,
              but keep in mind that a good fit for one person isn't always the
              same for another. Slight differences in foot shape, size, support,
              sensitivity, rubber, and even intended use - whether it's
              bouldering, top rope, multipitch, trad, indoor or outdoors - can
              make a huge difference in comfort and precision. It takes
              research, but don't fret. We're here to explain how to choose a
              climbing shoe, identify your size and fit, and what else you need
              to consider when choosing a shoe that's right for you.

                  If you asked someone about fitting shoes, they are going to
                  say something like: “uncomfortable”, “tight but not painful”,
                  “snug” and “toes curled”. These are all used to describe a
                  position where all the toes are touching the front of the shoe
                  in a half curled position, with no pressure points causing
                  immediate pain or too much discomfort, and with no significant
                  air gaps under the arch or around the heel. A small amount of
                  air under the heel is normal as long as the heel doesn't slip
                  off, which can lead to blisters. That being said. Your toes
                  should never lie completely flat because your toes naturally
                  curl when the muscles engage, which will leave you with wiggle
                  room.

                  Engaged, curled toes allows us to support our body weight on a
                  small surface area or edge. Your climbing shoe may feel tight
                  at first, but as it stretches, your toes will relax into the
                  shoe. Also, our toes need to be curled when fitting a shoe so
                  they don’t ‘pull back’ away from the front when they’re used
                  to climb. Shoes that are too big will feel like they “slip”
                  off holds since your body weight is away from the front of the
                  shoe.​

                  It’s worth remembering that, depending on the material of the
                  shoe, you will likely experience some stretch in your shoes.
                  At its most basic level, upper materials can be grouped into
                  three categories; Leather, synthetic, or a combination of
                  both. These uppers all offer a different amount of stretch. If
                  you have your eye on a pair of leather climbing shoes, be
                  prepared to see them stretch up to a whole size bigger (if not
                  more) after breaking them in. Hybrid uppers will still stretch
                  a little in the areas that use leather but won’t see much
                  stretch in the parts that use synthetic materials. For these
                  types of shoes, you can expect to see about a ½ size growth.
                  Synthetic uppers, on the other hand, will hardly stretch at
                  all throughout the course of their life. You will also want to
                  consider if your uppers are lined or unlined. If an upper is
                  unlined, there will only be one layer of material, so it will
                  stretch more than its lined counterparts.

                  Knowing the size of your foot is a good start but if you
                  really want to get the right size rock climbing shoes then you
                  will need to know how each brand sizes their shoes. Remember
                  how each manufacturer uses its own last shapes? Because these
                  lasts aren’t standard, sizing isn’t consistent between
                  manufacturers. This means a size 42 EU in Scarpa will give a
                  completely different fit from a 42 EU in an Evolv shoe. For
                  example Italian brands such as Scarpa or La Sportiva have a
                  reputation for running on the big side and recommend user
                  downsize their shoe sometime as much as 2 EU whole size down.
                  However American brands such as Mad Rock or Evolv generally
                  run closer to your street shoe size and require less of a need
                  to down size. So do your research depending on the brand to
                  find the best and closest fit.

                  What style of climbing you intend on pursuing, and the
                  intensity at which you do it is another important factor you
                  will want to consider when deciding what size climbing shoe to
                  wear. If you are looking for a serious-sending shoe for
                  sending hard bouldering and sport routes, then a performance
                  fit shoe is more desirable. If you are just looking for a shoe
                  for training or as an everyday workhorse, then a fit like this
                  is probably a little excessive. Again, trad or multi-pitching
                  are other examples of when comfort is more of a priority than
                  performance. Regardless of whether you want a performance or a
                  comfortable fit, just remember that your toes should never be
                  completely flat!

                  Okay, so know how you have put the shoe properly, but how do
                  you know if it actually fits? After all, climbing shoes aren’t
                  meant to be like comfortable slippers, so what are the key
                  signs you have the right climbing shoe size? First things
                  first, this isn’t like a pair of sneakers that you should walk
                  around your house with. Climbing shoes aren’t designed for
                  walking in – doing this offers you no real help – and
                  excessive walking can damage that beautiful downturned camber.
                  First, let’s talk about signs that suggest your shoes are too
                  big. My favorite method for testing shoes is by simply raising
                  my heel up and pressing the toe into the ground (or an
                  elevated edge somewhere around your house). If you have the
                  right size shoe you should instantly feel those tensioned
                  rubber rands keeping that shoe tightly compressed around your
                  foot.
