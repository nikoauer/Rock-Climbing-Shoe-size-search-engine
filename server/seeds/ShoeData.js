The midsole is medium stiffness and the sole features Boreal's integrated rand system, a one piece sole that has different thicknesses of rubber for support and flexibility where needed, and excellent durability, giving zero chance of delaminating. The heel has an EVA shock absorbing insert to protect the foot when walking between routes and jumping down from boulders without any loss of performance.

      "Details": "The Boreal Joker Plus has a new super-comfortable semi-asymmetric last with slimmer fitting heel and low tension rand. An upper of high quality split leather and synthetic microfibre is combined with a PU Air Net lining for exceptional comfort and a fresh new look. The shoe now features a closure of 3 opposing straps, for enhanced fit while retaining convenience. The padded HFS (Heel Fit System) provides a superb fit with reduced bulk. A newly developed outsole now includes a specially shaped heel cavity, allowing the shock absorbing EVA of our Cushioned Heel System to work more effectively without impeding fit. A new stiffer midsole helps provide support while edging, and the sticky and durable Zenith Quattro rubber provides the ideal blend of durability and friction. The Joker Plus is ideal for comfortable all-day climbing. Longer routes in the mountains, full days at the crag and extended training sessions; all the pleasure without the pain",
